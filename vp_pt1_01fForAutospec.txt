bundle exec autotest : OUT, bundle exec guard : IN
    this wouldn't work for autotest *gasp*
        i noticed in the git repo, the ?codio? or some servicer for the saas book/course updated
        things recently. and for some time, perhaps long b4 this recent update, 3.3.8 was ruby version.

        i expected some trouble but bundle 'mostly worked.' the thing is, the spec in docs isnt updated
            at lesat i hope thats all

    spec in docs isnt updated, so instead of autotest i'll be working with Guard and
        guard and guard-rspec

    i copied my Gemfile to gemini and it quickly diagnosed the problem.
        yeet

defensive programming or better yet: defensive building from spec
    the spec is here. still using an rspec file. the command is

    asking gemini for help with Guard vs Autotest startup and basics
